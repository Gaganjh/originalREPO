#glossary entries
glossary.entry.term.alpha=Alpha
glossary.entry.definition.alpha=Alpha is the average active return (annualized) for a fund during the 36-month period as of the date of this report.
glossary.entry.term.benchmark.NY=Benchmark
glossary.entry.term.benchmark.USA=Benchmark
glossary.entry.definition.benchmark.NY=A standard, usually a market index or peer group average, to which the performance of a fund is compared for evaluative purposes. John Hancock New York selects the benchmarks and/or peer group average for each of our Funds that we believe most closely match the sub-account in terms of investment objective, policies, process and style. Please note that is the responsibility of the plan fiduciary to determine the appropriate benchmarks for evaluating the investment options offered to a qualified retirement plan.

glossary.entry.term.beta=Beta
glossary.entry.definition.beta=Beta represents the sensitivity of a fund's returns to the returns on its benchmark. A fund that has a beta greater than 1.00 with respect to its benchmark has been more volatile than its benchmark. A fund with a beta less than 1.00 has been less volatile than its benchmark.
glossary.entry.term.informationRatio=Information Ratio
glossary.entry.definition.informationRatio=The Information Ratio measures the level and consistency of a fund's active return (return in excess of a benchmark). The ratio is calculated by dividing a fund's alpha by its active risk (annualized standard deviation of the active return). The Fund with the highest information ratio showed the greatest level of consistency in beating its benchmark.
glossary.entry.term.rSquared=R-squared
glossary.entry.definition.rSquared=R-squared is used to measure the "correspondence" or "fit" between a fund's investment style and that of its benchmark. R-squared can range from 0% to 100%. Funds with a high R-squared generally exhibit similar volatility patterns to their benchmark, indicating they are probably representative of the asset class or style defined by the benchmark.
glossary.entry.term.sharpeRatio=Sharpe Ratio
glossary.entry.definition.sharpeRatio=In the context of this report, the Sharpe Ratio is a measure of the relationship of reward to risk. A higher ratio indicates a safer investment strategy. It is measured by dividing a fund's average annualized excess return by the annualized standard deviation of its excess return.
glossary.entry.term.standardDeviation=Standard Deviation
glossary.entry.definition.standardDeviation=Standard deviation provides a measure of return variability. For example, a fund with a high standard deviation can be expected to have a wide range of annual returns and thus a relatively high level of risk. This is particularly true for funds investing in technology stocks, small cap stocks or stocks in emerging/foreign markets. In contrast, a fund with a relatively low standard deviation can be expected to have a narrow range of annual returns and thus low risk - such as a money market fund.
